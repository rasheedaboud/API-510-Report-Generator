## [API 510 Report Generator](https://witty-desert-03f45541e.2.azurestaticapps.net/)
Hi there! This app is an example of how the pressure equipment industry can leverage LLM (Large Language Models) AI to help us write reports much more efficiently. This example uses a dynamic checklist for input to the report. However we dont need to stop there! ARMM SERVICES also has the ability to extract information from paper forms and feed the data through our generative software.

One of the most costly aspects of any inspection activity is waiting for reports. Its not uncommon to ask for a ‘Bootleg’ copy so that so they can start to assess findings as early as possible and start planning any required mitigations. Whether that be repairs, alterations or fitness for service.

Using technology similar to this reporting time can be reduced by up to 90%. That translates to direct saving for your clients. If less time is spent reporting you can utilize smaller crews to inspect more equipment, which in turn could allow you to capture large market share across the industry. If you’re an owner user this means additional savings, not only by reduced crew size but also by getting information back as efficiently as possible.
